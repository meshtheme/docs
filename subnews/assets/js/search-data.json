    "content": "1. Background Color . Default: Transparent (rgba(0,0,0,0)) . Set a background color for this slide. Useful when: . | Using no background image | Creating solid color slides | Adding color behind semi-transparent images | Creating gradient effects (via custom CSS) | . Supports: RGB, RGBA (with transparency), HEX colors . 2. Background Image . Required field . Upload your slide background image or video. Supported Formats: . | Images: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP | Videos: MP4, WebM, WebP, OGG, WMV, MOV, AVI | . Recommended Image Specifications: . | Dimensions: 1920x1080px (Full HD) or 2560x1440px (2K) | Aspect Ratio: 16:9 for standard screens | File Size: Under 500KB (optimize before upload) | Format: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency | . Video Background Tips: . | Keep videos under 10MB for performance | Use MP4 format for best compatibility | Videos auto-play (muted) on desktop | Videos don’t auto-play on mobile (shows poster frame) | Compress videos before uploading | . 3. Mobile/Tablet Image Focal Point . Default: 50% 50% (Center) . Control which part of your image remains visible on smaller screens. How to Use: . | Drag the red-and-white focal point dot on the image preview | Position it on the most important part of your image | Or enter custom position values manually | . Position Values: . | First value: Horizontal position (left to right) | Second value: Vertical position (top to bottom) | . Examples: . | 50% 50% - Center (default) | 50% 30% - Center horizontally, upper third vertically | 20% 50% - Left side, centered vertically | 80% 50% - Right side, centered vertically | 50% 70% - Center horizontally, lower third vertically | . Why This Matters: Large images get cropped on mobile devices. The focal point ensures your subject (person’s face, product, logo) stays visible and centered on all screen sizes. 4. Description . Supports: Full HTML and WordPress editor . Add your slide content using the visual editor: . | Headlines and subheadings | Paragraphs and text | Lists (bulleted or numbered) | Bold, italic, underline formatting | Links | Custom HTML | . Tips: . | Keep text concise for better readability | Use heading tags (H1-H6) for proper hierarchy | Test readability against your background image | Use the overlay color to improve text contrast | . 5. Slide Overlay Color . Default: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) (10% black) . Add a semi-transparent color layer over the background image to improve text readability. Common Overlay Colors: . | rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) - 30% black (subtle darkening) | rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) - 50% black (medium darkening) | rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7) - 70% black (strong darkening) | rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) - 30% white (lightening) | rgba(29, 53, 87, 0.6) - 60% dark blue (branded overlay) | . Tips: . | Darker overlays work better with white text | Lighter overlays work better with dark text | Adjust opacity (last value) to find the right balance | Match overlay color to your brand for consistency | . 6. Slide Text Color . Default: #ffffff (White) . Set the color for all text in this slide. Best Practices: . | Use white (#ffffff) with dark backgrounds/overlays | Use dark colors (#333333) with light backgrounds | Ensure sufficient contrast for readability | Test on actual devices for visibility | Consider accessibility standards (WCAG AA minimum) | . 7. Text Position . Default: Center Center . Choose where your text content appears on the slide. Available Positions: . | Top Left - Upper left corner | Top Center - Top, horizontally centered | Top Right - Upper right corner | Center Left - Left side, vertically centered | Center Center - Dead center (default, most common) | Center Right - Right side, vertically centered | Bottom Left - Lower left corner | Bottom Center - Bottom, horizontally centered | Bottom Right - Lower right corner | . Usage Tips: . | Center Center: Best for hero sections, featured content | Top positions: Good for banners with action buttons | Bottom positions: Works well with people/products in upper portion | Side positions: Creates dynamic, magazine-style layouts | . 8. Text Position Spacing . Default: None . Add additional left or right spacing for extra-large screens (XL breakpoint and above). Available Options: . Left Spacing: . | ps-xl-1--ms-xl-1 - Left space 1 (small) | ps-xl-2--ms-xl-2 - Left space 2 | ps-xl-3--ms-xl-3 - Left space 3 | ps-xl-4--ms-xl-4 - Left space 4 | ps-xl-5--ms-xl-5 - Left space 5 (large) | . Right Spacing: . | pe-xl-1--me-xl-1 - Right space 1 (small) | pe-xl-2--me-xl-2 - Right space 2 | pe-xl-3--me-xl-3 - Right space 3 | pe-xl-4--me-xl-4 - Right space 4 | pe-xl-5--me-xl-5 - Right space 5 (large) | . When to Use: . | Push text away from screen edges on wide monitors | Create asymmetric layouts | Accommodate specific design requirements | Balance with background image composition | . Note: Only affects XL screens (1200px and wider). Smaller screens use standard responsive spacing. 9. Text Alignment . Default: Left . Set horizontal text alignment within the text block. Options: . | Left - Text aligned to left edge (default, most readable) | Center - Text centered (good for short headlines) | Right - Text aligned to right edge (creates dynamic look) | . Recommendation: . | Left alignment: Best for body text and paragraphs | Center alignment: Good for headlines and short text | Right alignment: Use sparingly for design effect | . 10. Text Area Max-Width . Default: Full width . Limit the maximum width of the text content block. Example Values: . | 700px - Narrow column (good for readability) | 900px - Medium width | 1200px - Wide content | 50% - Half the slide width | Leave empty for full width | . Why Use This: Long lines of text are hard to read. Limiting width to 700-900px improves readability, especially for paragraphs. Best Practice: For slides with multiple sentences, use 600-800px for optimal reading experience. 11. Primary Button Link . Optional . Enter the URL where the primary button should link. Supported URL Types: . | External: https://example.com | Internal page: /about-us/ | Anchor link: #section-id | Email: mailto:info@example.com | Phone: tel:+1234567890 | .

Enter the text displayed on the primary button. Examples: . | “Learn More” | “Get Started” | “Shop Now” | “View Portfolio” | “Contact Us” | “Download Free Guide” | . Best Practices: . | Use action-oriented text | Keep it short (2-4 words) | Make it specific and clear | Avoid generic “Click Here” | . 13. Secondary Button Link . Optional . Enter the URL for the secondary (second) button. Same format as Primary Button Link. When to Use Secondary Button: . | Offer alternative action (e.g., “Learn More” + “Watch Video”) | Provide choice (e.g., “Buy Now” + “Try Demo”) | Create hierarchy of actions | . 14. Secondary Button Text . Optional . Text for the secondary button. Examples: . | “Watch Video” | “Learn More” | “See Demo” | “View Details” | .
